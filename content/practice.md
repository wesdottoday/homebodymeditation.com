intro: |
  A gentle steady way to begin, or return to, meditation in the midst of real life.
  
  These individual sessions offers space to slow down, listen in, and practice presence in a way that feels supportive and lived-in. We meet weekly for 45 minutes, blending conversation, guided meditation and reflection.

  This work isn't about getting meditation "right."
  It's about creating small, steady moments of connection you can return to.

      Over five weeks, we'll move at a natural pace, guided by what feels most supportive for you.

      - Simple breath and body awareness
      - Creating a sense of inner space and steadiness
      - Learning how to meet whatever is present with a bit more curiosity
      - Finding ways to practice that fit into real life

      The final sessions are shaped by what feels most helpful to you.
