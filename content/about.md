Hello! I'm Melissa, a meditation teacher and the heart behind Homebody Meditation.

I believe meditation doesn't have to look a certain way to be meaningful. My approach is relational and real, grounded in conversation, shaped by curiosity, and rooted in the understanding that connection is always available even in the middle of real life. I teach meditation in a warm, grounded way and invite people to return to themselves with softness rather than striving.

Since I can remember, I've always been drawn to finding an inner steadiness, a quiet confidence that helps me meet life as it is. And let's be real, it has been and continues to be a journey. I first started practicing meditation in 2019 when I attended an 8 week Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy series at The Ohio State University. After experiencing the benefits from that series, I began taking meditation classes at Radiant Yoga and Wellness in Worthington, Ohio with Stephanie Estice. These classes helped me through the pandemic and pregnancy and ultimately led me to Michele Vinbury's Untamed Wisdom Meditation Teacher Training. My intention was to take the course to deepen my own personal practice. That it did, and then some.

My path into meditation began during a time of transition, when I was searching for a way to feel grounded in the middle of everyday life. Over time, that search became a practice, and that practice became something I wanted to share with others; it's not perfect but it's become a place that feels like home to me.

My approach is gentle and relational. Each session begins with what's present, a conversation, a breath, a moment to land. From there, we move through meditation that supports you in exploring awareness and connection and even the inevitable moments of distraction. From breathwatching to body scans and personalized guided imagery meditations, the practice adapts to meet you, because there's no one right way to begin.

What I hope most is that this work helps you remember your own capacity for connection to yourself, not just during meditation, but in the middle of real life. To rediscover that you already carry what you need, and that presence can be a steady companion along the way, like coming home.
