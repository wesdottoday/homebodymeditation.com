I’m Melissa, a meditation teacher who came to this work through lived experience and a steady personal practice.

Meditation became meaningful to me when it became something I could return to, a way to pause, breathe, and check in during everyday moments, not just when things were quiet or easy. I didn’t set out to teach; sharing this work grew naturally after completing Untamed Wisdom Meditation Teacher Training in 2024, as a way to offer what had become genuinely supportive in my own life.

When I’m practicing with others, I’m attentive to pace, simplicity, and creating space where nothing needs to be forced or fixed. I care about offering meditation in a way that feels human and doable, something you can actually bring into your daily life, rather than another thing to get right.

Much of my own practice happens in ordinary moments, morning meditations, quiet pauses between tasks, or sitting near a window and noticing the light, often guided by natural rhythms like seasons and shifts in energy.
