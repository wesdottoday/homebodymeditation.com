Rooted Sessions offer space to slow down, listen in, and begin (or return to) a meditation practice that feels grounded in real life.

Each week, we meet for a 45-minute session, a blend of conversation, guided meditation, and reflection. Between sessions, you'll receive a recorded practice meditation, created by me, to support a simple daily rhythm at home.

## What We'll Explore

Over five weeks, we'll explore a few foundational meditation practices:

- We'll begin with simple **breathwatching** and **body awareness**
- Then move toward creating a sense of **inner space** and **steadiness**
- The final sessions are shaped by what feels most helpful for you, with room to focus on **grounding**, **rest**, or **seasonal rhythms**

The pace remains gentle and flexible, adapting to what you're noticing week to week.

## What You'll Receive

- **Five one-on-one meditation sessions** (45 minutes each)
- **Five recorded practice meditations**
- **Gentle weekly guidance and reflection**

## Format & Pricing

**Format:** Virtual (Zoom) or in-person (if available)

**Pricing:** $550 for the full 5-week series (discounted) or $125 per week

*Sliding scale available for BIPOC and marginalized clients. If cost is a concern, reach out and we can find an option that feels manageable.*

## Ready to Begin?

If something here resonates, I'm happy to offer a complimentary 15-minute phone call so we can connect, talk through what you're hoping for, and see if this feels like a supportive fit.
